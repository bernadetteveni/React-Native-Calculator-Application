# React Native Calculator Application

## Objective 
To implement a simple, non-scientific "10-key" calculator created in react native. The application consists of four functions (“+”, “-”, “*”, “/”), and a function to work with decimals. “DEL” and “CLEAR” keys are also provided. The “DEL” acts as a backspace for the user to delete the last inputted key. The “CLEAR” key wipes all inputted keys from the display and in memory. Division by 0 is also accepted. A settings page is included to allow the user to toggle button vibration feedback as well as dark mode vs. light mode. The vibration feedback will allow the device to vibrate when the buttons are pressed. The application’s UI theme will toggle from a dark theme to a light theme when the switch is disabled and vice versa.
